## Problems ##

### Problem 1: ###
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.  
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Answer:
233168

### Problem 2: ###
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:  
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...  
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
